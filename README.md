# Market Regime & Risk Engine

## Overview
This project explores how market regimes and volatility dynamics
impact trading decision quality and risk exposure.

## Problem Statement
Most retail trading systems fail because they ignore market regime
and apply static risk across all conditions.

## Solution
A rule-based, explainable framework that:
- Classifies market regimes
- Adjusts risk based on volatility
- Gates trade decisions to avoid low-quality environments

## Design Philosophy
- Risk-first
- Explainability over complexity
- Systems > signals

## Limitations
This is not a predictive or ML-based system.
Performance depends on regime stability and parameter selection.

## Future Work
- Statistical regime models
- Machine learning classification
- Multi-asset analysis
